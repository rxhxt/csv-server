**CSV Server** is a robust Python library and CLI tool that instantly turns your CSV files into a fully-featured REST API. Inspired by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), it is designed for rapid prototyping, data exploration, and lightweight data services‚Äîno database required.

---

## Features

- üöÄ **Instant REST API**: Serve any folder of CSV files as RESTful endpoints.
- üîí **Read-Only by Default**: Safe, non-destructive access; enable writes as needed.
- üÜî **Auto-ID Management**: Automatic primary key synthesis and incrementing.
- üîé **Advanced Querying**: Search, filter, sort, and paginate results.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Writes**: Atomic file operations with file locking.
- üìñ **Interactive API Docs**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`.
- ‚ö° **CLI & Python API**: Use as a command-line tool or integrate as a library.
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes pytest-based test suite.
- üêç **Modern Python**: Type hints, linting, and optional pandas support for large datasets.

## Installation

```bash
pip install csv-server
```

---

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```bash
csv-server serve ./data --port 8000
```

- Instantly exposes all CSV files in `./data` as REST endpoints.
- Visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) for interactive API documentation.

```python
from csv_server import serve_csv_directory

serve_csv_directory("./data", port=8000, readonly=True)
```

## API Overview

For each CSV file (e.g., `users.csv`), the following endpoints are generated:

| Method | Endpoint            | Description                        |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/users`            | List rows with query support       |
| GET    | `/users/{id}`       | Fetch a single row by ID           |
| POST   | `/users`            | Add a new row (if not read-only)   |
| PUT    | `/users/{id}`       | Replace a row (if not read-only)   |
| PATCH  | `/users/{id}`       | Update a row (if not read-only)    |
| DELETE | `/users/{id}`       | Delete a row (if not read-only)    |
| GET    | `/users/schema`     | Get inferred column schema         |

### Query Parameters

- `q`: Full-text search
- `filter`: Field-based filtering (e.g., `filter=age:gt:30`)
- `sort`: Sorting (e.g., `sort=name:asc`)
- `limit` & `offset`: Pagination

## Configuration

You can use a YAML config file for advanced setup:

```yaml
resources:
  users:
    file: "users.csv"
    primary_key: "id"
    readonly: false
  orders:
    file: "orders.csv"
    primary_key: "order_id"
    readonly: true
```

Run with:

```bash
csv-server serve ./data --config config.yaml
```

---

## Example Data

Sample CSV files are provided in `examples/data/` for demonstration and testing.

---

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] SQLite backend for large datasets
- [ ] Hot reload for CSV file changes
- [ ] Resource relationships (foreign keys)
- [ ] Docker image for easy deployment
